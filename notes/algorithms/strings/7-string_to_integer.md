This problem is all about carefully converting a string into an integer without using built-in methods like `Integer.parseInt()`. You're expected to handle the same edge cases that a low-level C-style `atoi()` function would deal with — leading spaces, signs, invalid characters, and overflows.

#### Step 1: Skip the Leading Whitespace

First, you need to trim off any spaces at the beginning of the string. This is critical because we don't want to misinterpret space characters as invalid input. We do this by incrementing an index until we hit a non-space character.

#### Step 2: Check for a Sign

Once the whitespace is out of the way, we check whether the first character is a '+' or '-'. If we find one, we record the sign (either `+1` or `-1`) and move the index forward. If there is no sign, we default to positive.

#### Step 3: Convert Characters to Digits

Now we start scanning characters one by one. As long as the current character is a digit (`'0'` to `'9'`), we convert it into an integer. This is done by subtracting `'0'` from the character (since characters in Java are based on ASCII values, `'5' - '0'` gives 5).

#### Step 4: Handle Overflow

Before adding the digit to our result, we need to be cautious about overflow. If adding the digit would push the total past `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (for positive numbers) or `Integer.MIN_VALUE` (for negatives), we immediately return the clamped value. The safe way to do this is to use a formula that checks whether `total * 10 + digit` would overflow before we actually do the multiplication or addition.

#### Step 5: Return the Result

Once we’ve processed all the digits or hit an invalid character, we multiply the result by the sign (positive or negative) and return it.

Below is a code implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int myAtoi(String s) {
        int index = 0, total = 0, sign = 1;

        // Step 1: Ignore leading whitespace
        while (index < s.length() && s.charAt(index) == ' ') {
            index++;
        }

        // Step 2: Check for empty string after spaces
        if (index == s.length()) return 0;

        // Step 3: Check for sign
        if (s.charAt(index) == '+' || s.charAt(index) == '-') {
            sign = (s.charAt(index) == '-') ? -1 : 1;
            index++;
        }

        // Step 4: Convert digits and handle overflow
        while (index < s.length() && Character.isDigit(s.charAt(index))) {
            int digit = s.charAt(index) - '0';

            // Check if total will overflow after 10x + digit
            if (total > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 10) {
                return sign == 1 ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            }

            total = total * 10 + digit;
            index++;
        }

        return total * sign;
    }
}
```
